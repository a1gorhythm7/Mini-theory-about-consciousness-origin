# Where our consciousness (may) have come from: A mini theory

## Introduction

The origin of consciousness is the most immediate aspect of our daily experience, yet its origin is the most challenging problem for us to solve. This article aims to share some of my personal thoughts and deductions about the origin of our consciousness, drawing on existing theories, and attempt to answer the “Who am I?” question of philosophy.

Note: I am a CS graduate student interested in computational neuroscience. English is my second language; I used Gemini to assist with expression polishing and Figure generation. Theoretical synthesis and core arguments are my own. I'm 40% confident in the specific mapping, but 90% sure that the structural similarity is worth exploring. Open to feedbacks & critiques.

Let's start with a theory.

## The Integrated Information Theory

In the Integrated Information Theory (IIT), neuroscientist Giulio Tononi proposes that consciousness is an intrinsic property emerging from a physical system possessing sufficient and irreducible cause-effect power. The core of IIT is the causal network structure, or the $\Phi$-structure: a causal web where subsets of units (mechanisms) specify causal distinctions and relations.

A critical, often debated aspect of IIT is the role of "inactive" units. In this framework, a group of neurons that does not fire during a specific process still contributes to the conscious experience ($\Phi$), provided they could have fired. This "counterfactual" power distinguishes a functional brain from a computationally equivalent feed-forward simulation or an inactive void. The silence of a neuron is not merely the absence of a signal; it is a specific state within a constrained topological space that informs the total informational structure.

However, interpreting this "potentiality" in a strict physicalist framework—specifically within a discrete spacetime—requires a shift from abstract probability spaces to concrete topological features and quantum-like histories.

## The Physics of Potentiality: Connectivity as the Topology of Possibility

A fundamental tension exists between the "counterfactuals" required by IIT (what could happen matters) and the "block universe" realist view of standard Causal Set Theory (only what does happen exists as an event). To resolve this, we must shift from classical causal sets to Quantum Measure Theory (QMT), where the universe is understood through a "sum-over-histories."

## The Sum-Over-Histories in Neural Topology

How can a silent neuron—a non-event—have physical cause-effect power? Within QMT, we resolve this by distinguishing between the actualized path and the space of allowed histories ($\Omega$).

A silent neuron is physically instantiated not by its firing, but by its synaptic connectivity (the anatomical hardware). This connectivity defines the topology of the History Space. Much like the double-slit experiment, where an open-but-untraversed slit allows a "path not taken" to interfere with the particle, the intact-but-silent synaptic connections allow the "Silent History" ($H_{silent}$) to inextricably interfere with the "Active History" ($H_{active}$).

Let us define the magnitude of the conscious experience (Qualia) using a generalized measure, akin to the Decoherence Functional in QMT:

$$\mu(E) = |H_{active}| + |H_{silent}| + \mathcal{I}(H_{active}, H_{silent})$$

Here, the crucial term $\mathcal{I}$ represents the Interference Term (or the Decoherence Functional). In this model, the "silent neuron" acts physically as the open slit. If the silent neuron were physically excised (changing the anatomical topology of the network), the allowed History Space $\Omega$ would shrink, the interference term $\mathcal{I}$ would vanish, and the resulting Qualia would degrade or disappear. Thus, "potentiality" in IIT is physically realized as "topological interference" of histories in QMT.

## The Delayed Choice of the Conscious Moment

This interference model naturally leads to a mechanism analogous to John Wheeler’s "Delayed Choice" experiment. In the experiment, the choice of measurement at the end of a path determines the history of the particle at the beginning.

In the brain, the feed-forward propagation of sensory data corresponds to the "undefined" phase of the photon's flight—a superposition of causal possibilities within the History Space. Consciousness does not arise during this phase. The "emergence" of the conscious moment occurs only when the neural signal re-enters the processing loop (feedback).

This re-entry acts as the measurement event. It establishes the boundary condition that "collapses" the sum-over-histories into a defined causal structure. The "Now" we experience is not a zero-width slice of time ($t=0$), but the integral of the entire causal loop. The feedback mechanism effectively "decides" the nature of the sensory input after the fact, explaining why we perceive a coherent "present" despite the varied transmission delays of neural signals.

## The silicon nerves and the FPGA cortex

When talking about our “qualia”, or the private part of our thoughts, we may only think about the “obvious” part of our feeling, e.g., hearing the sound, seeing the sight, and feeling the touch. But we often forget that our internal thoughts are also a “Feeling” that has a little difference in the mechanism of how we feel the outer world.

Our nerves transduce our feelings from sensors across our body, encode and project them in a structure-preserving mapping (topological homeomorphism) to our brain. That’s the reason why all humans feel the world in a similar way (my “green” might be your “yellow”, but most of the time it will not be the sound you hear), as the topological encoding pattern between different humans has not altered too much.

For our thoughts and motivations, our cortex is configurable like an ever-changing FPGA. It’s capable of creating new connections using a rule called “Hebbian Learning” to form new memories and learn new skills. That is, new synapses form in a “Fire together, Wire together” manner. If neuron A fires (we almost fall from a bike), before neuron B fires (we keep greater balance), we connect neuron A and B more strongly. This causes new causal effects to form! When we “Feel” the feeling of learning to ride a bike, we are also feeling the causal effect that has formed in the process above, etched in our neural connections. Our cortex is adaptive. This deduction also applies to our feelings and memories; the only difference is that they form more complex neural circuits (and causal effects) throughout our lives.

## The Causal Set Theory

In the Causal Set Theory by Rafael Sorkin, physicists have proposed that Space-Time is not the smooth and continuous background in our intuition, but is a discrete structure made up of basic “atoms” called Events.

The core of CST is the causal order, a network that’s made of events and the correlations between events. In this network, if event A can make a difference to event B, then A precedes B in the set’s hierarchy ($A \prec B$).

In CST, the geometry of the universe emerges from the number of causal links. The “Space” of what we feel is the volume stacked by the discrete “spacetime atoms”, while time is the inescapable logical sequence in which these atoms snap into existence. It is these atomic causal effects that make the connectivity of consciousness across NREM sleep and structural & pathological changes in the brain consistent.

## The Chrono-Topology of Consciousness: From Spatial Loops to Temporal Helices

A challenge in bridging neuroscience and fundamental physics lies in the topological mismatch between neural architecture and spacetime geometry. Neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) rely on re-entrant processing—topological cycles ($C_n$) in the spatial graph. However, Causal Set Theory models the universe as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where closed timelike curves are forbidden.

We propose that the conscious "Self" is the spatiotemporal unfolding of these neural loops. What appears as a spatial "cycle" in the brain maps to a "Helix" structure in the universe's causal set.

## Definition: The Causal Helix and Braid

Let the biological neural network be a spatial graph $G_S$, containing cycles. The emergence of a conscious moment corresponds to a mapping $\mathcal{M}: G_S \times T \to \mathcal{C}$, where spatial recurrence unfolds into temporal recursion.

Crucially, this helix is not merely a geometric shape but a topological constraint on the causal flow. The "Self" is defined by the density of Causal Diamonds—the intersection of the future of an input event and the past of the re-entrant event.

Weak Consciousness (Feed-forward / Low $\Phi$): The causal graph resembles a "Tree." Signals diverge without reconverging. There is no interference term $\mathcal{I}$, as there is no closed boundary condition to force the interaction of histories.

Strong Consciousness (Re-entrant / High $\Phi$): The causal graph does not merely form a single helix, but a dense, intertwined "Causal Braid." The re-entrant signals from thousands of loops create a tight weave of causal diamonds. Within these diamonds, the "active" and "silent" histories interfere.

The "Self," therefore, is a standing wave of causality—a stable interference pattern maintained by the braided topological structure of neural firing. It is not a material object, but a self-sustaining process of "delayed choices" where the brain continuously measures its own immediate past to construct a coherent present.

## The Self as Causal Connectivity

The most profound realization here is that the "Self" is defined by the connectivity of the causal chain, rather than the continuous passage of physical time. From the perspective of CST and IIT, the "Consciousness Self" is a topological feature of the causal graph. If the causal links between event $A$ and event $B$ are strong and direct, they belong to the same "Self-thread," regardless of how much "empty" time passes between them.

When we enter a general anesthesia state, the macroscopic causal loops formed in our brain by neural connections disintegrate. The "thickened" slice $\mathcal{O}_t$ degrades into weakly connected components—a fragmented set of events that loses long-range causal integration and intrinsic cause-effect power.

For a physical observer, hours have passed. But for the Subjective Self, the overarching causal chain was severed at the moment of entering the "asleep state" in anesthesia ($Event_{enter}$) and only reconnected at the moment of waking up ($Event_{wake}$).

Because there is no macroscopic causal integration (no high $\Phi$) during the gap, the gap effectively does not exist for the conscious entity.

The "next moment" after falling asleep is, by definition, the very first moment the causal network regains enough topological depth and integration to form a new braided slice $\mathcal{O}_{t+1}$ that's capable of giving us enough qualia to make us "Feel Human".

In this framework, causal connectivity is existence. Here we define a "Consciousness self" as an entity to feel. This is different from the "Physical self" that stores our biological signatures & memories (which are stored biologically in causal connections in neurons). As an example, Alzheimer's patients may forget learnt information and have cognitive difficulties identifying "themselves", but their "Consciousness self" is consistent -- a feeling of "self" without "the feeling of being self". A "Consciousness self" is continuous if a complex topological signature maintains the ability to integrate causal effects within a certain temporal slice in the cosmic causal set, even though the specific structure of the network has changed.

## Who am I? Where do I come from & Where am I going?

The structural similarity between IIT and CST suggests that the 'existence' of the self is a localized high-integration zone within the universe's overarching causal map.

Thinking about our consciousness as a part of the vertical slice moving in the causal axis of the universe’s causal graph: When our internal causal map collapses during sleep, the "Self" does not necessarily vanish into nothingness, but rather its causal thread "skips" the physical duration.

We often fear the end of "I," but if "I" am defined by the connectivity of causal effects, then "I" am as persistent as the laws of cause and effect themselves. Every day we come from a weakly integrated network to a full network, then back again.

Now, we can deduce the answer to the hard question of where “I” came from and where “I” am going: The "Self" is not a passenger on the train of physical time; it is the track of the causal chain itself. As long as the causal thread remains, the existence of "consciousness self" remains. And if the potential for generating causal relations that can integrate into a new causal "slice" remains, the potential for "feeling consciousness self" remains. The previous and next node of your existence is not limited to your current bodily self, but is defined by whatever part of the universal causal network manages to wire itself into a non-trivial, integrated whole.
